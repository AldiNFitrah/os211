# Top 10 List of Week 03

### 1. [File Permissions & Atrributes](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/File_permissions_and_attributes)
When executing `ls -al`, we will see some random alphabets along with many dashes around them. This kind of thing intrigue me and I ended up in this site which cover this topic pretty clear. It also tells us how to modify those alphabets (which also means modifying file permission).

### 2. [Structures of Directory in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structures-of-directory-in-operating-system/)
I read this 'Three-Structured Directories' from the course's material but can't find any article about it. I guess there might be typo. Anyway, this short article will give us a better understanding about directory structure in operating system. It also comes with some visualization to give us a clearer picture.

### 3. [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/filesystem-hierarchy-standard)
It's quite frustrating isn't it for us, windows user, when we don't see things like C:, D:, etc. Linux has its own "unusual" directories that can be overwhelming for beginner like me. What makes it more confusing is, they say different Linux distros can have their own unique directory. So here comes a help for us to understand about this Linux filesystem standard.

### 4. [File Allocation Methods](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-allocation-methods/)
I'm sure we've heard this "contiguous" word when we learn about Linked LIst in the data structure and algorithm class. Now, we will dive deeper about it and this article will be our helper. Again, geeksforgeeks always has a great picture that really helps us, the reader.

### 5. [Directory Implementation](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-directory-implementation)
Woah, this one's also related to what we've learned in the data structure and algorithm class. This site explained it concisely and I think it's a good starting point for us to understand more about this topic.

### 6. [File Systems Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV0-EPUYuQc)
I personally don't really understand about this file systems stuff since it works nicely without needing me to know how it works. But here comes this guy who explained what a file system does in just 5 minutes. He also gave some simple comparisons of those file systems for us.

### 7. [Free Space Management](https://www.includehelp.com/operating-systems/free-space-management.aspx)
What this site is trying to tell us about is of course the free space management itself. It's a pretty short article and they use some bullet points to write the advantages and disadvantages of each free space management technique.

### 8. [Volume vs Partition](https://www.alphr.com/volume-vs-partition/)
When we're talking about storage in our gadgets, there are actually 2 types of it, one is volume, and the other one is partition. But I guess most of us don't know what are they why is it important. Come and visit the site and you will be enlightened about the difference between them.

### 9. [Virtual File Systems](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/virtual-filesystems-linux)
'Virtual filesystems are the magic abstraction that makes the "everything is a file" philosophy of Linux possible', this site said. Do you wanna know more about this virtual file system? The article will give us a brief explanation about it like how it works, why do we need them, etc.

### 10. [File System Mounting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8ITr5ZpzvA)
This thing is very new to me and it took me a lot of time to understand it. Well, me myself still don't get it really well for now, but seeing the likes number and those positive comments, I think this guy has already given the best explanation about the File System Mounting.
